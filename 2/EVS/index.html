        <h1>What is food waste??</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Food waste is food that is intended for human consumption that is wasted and lost, and refers not only to food that consumers don’t finish at restaurants and are thrown out at home, but also raw materials and produce that are lost in the farming stage, harvesting processes, during transportation, and storage. Food waste can occur anywhere throughout the entire supply chain.The volume of food waste globally is enough to feed three billion people, while food waste in Europe could feed 200 million people, in Latin America 300 million people and in Africa 300 million people. Food waste has significant effects on the environment, global and national economies, food security and nutrition. The increasing and persistent global demand for food is also driving fertile land useless while contributing to more land degradation and deforestation, which as a result, destroys our precious natural habitats and biodiversity, limiting the services that they provide and disrupting entire ecosystems.

        <h1>TOP FIVE MOST WASTED SOURCES FOODS</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">#1 Bread<br>Over 240 million slices of bread are chucked away every year. Bread freezes really well, particularly for toast, so make sure you pop in the freezer if you're not going to use it. Stale bread can be turned into croutons, breadcrumbs, eggy bread or even bread & butter pudding.</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">#2 Milk<br>Around 5.9 million glasses of milk are poured down the sink every year, but it's so easy to use it up. You can use large quantities of milk in a fruit smoothie, béchamel sauce or make rice (or barley) pudding. If your milk is on the turn have a go at curd cheese or paneer.</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">#3 Potatoes<br>We discard 5.8 million potatoes each year. Store potatoes in a dark place so they last longer. If they have been hanging around for a while, cook them all up and freeze in portions. Make potato cakes, fishcakes or gnocchi with leftover mash and bubble & squeak with leftover roasties. Par-boiled potatoes can be sliced and sautéed for a quick supper or roasted to make potato wedges (which can be cooked & frozen).</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">#4 Cheese<br>Cheese lasts a very long time, so there really is no excuse if you chuck it away! If it’s mouldy just scrape it off and use the rest in cooking. Cheese sauce is easy, just make a béchamel and add leftover scraps of any cheese - essential for lasagne, macaroni or cauliflower cheese and lots of other favourites. Finally, most cheese can be frozen.</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">#5 Apples<br>A staggering 1.3 million apples are thrown away each year. To make them last longer, store in a cold, dark and well-ventilated place - make sure they aren't touching each other and they are clean and dry.

                    Life is fast-paced and preparing nutritious meals can be a challenge, but healthy meals don't have to be elaborate. The internet is full of quick healthy recipes that you can share with your family and friends</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">2. Buy only what you need

                    Plan your meals. Make a shopping list and stick to it, and avoid impulse buys. Not only will you waste less food, you’ll also save money!</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">3. Pick ugly fruit and vegetables

                    Don’t judge food by its appearance! Oddly-shaped or bruised fruits and vegetables are often thrown away because they don’t meet arbitrary cosmetic standards. Don’t worry - they taste the same! Use mature fruit for smoothies, juices and desserts.</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">4. Store food wisely

                    Move older products to the front of your cupboard or fridge and new ones to the back. Use airtight containers to keep open food fresh in the fridge and ensure packets are closed to stop insects from getting in.

                <div class="aboutPoints">         1. LANDFILL<br>Disposing of waste in a landfill involves burying waste to dispose it off, and thisremains a common practice in most countries. Landfills were often established inabandoned or unusedquarries,miningvoids or  borrow pits. A properly-designedand well-managed landfill can be a hygienic and relatively inexpensive method of disposing of waste materials. Older, poorly-designed or poorly-managed landfillscan create a number of adverse environmental impacts such as wind-blownlitter ,attraction of vermin, and generation of liquidleachate. Another common byproductof landfills is gas (mostly composed of methaneandcarbon dioxide), which is produced as organic waste breaks downanaerobically. This gas can create odor  problems, kill surface vegetation, and is agreenhouse gas</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">2. RECYCLING METHODS<br>The process of extracting resources or value from waste is generally referred to asrecycling, meaning to recover or reuse the material. There are a number of differentmethods by which waste material is recycled: the raw materials may be extractedand reprocessed, or the calorific content of the waste may be converted toelectricity. New methods of recycling are being developed continuously, and aredescribed briefly below.</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">3. COMPOSTING<br>Composting operations of solid wastes include preparing refuse and degradingorganic matter by aerobic microorganisms. Refuse is presorted, to removematerials that might have salvage value or cannot be composted, and is ground upto improve the efficiency of the decomposition process. The refuse is placed inlong piles on the ground or deposited in mechanical systems, where it is degraded biologically to a humus with a total nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content of 1 to 3 percent, depending on the material being composted. After about threeweeks, the product is ready for curing, blending with additives, bagging, andmarketing.</div>

                    Food waste can be turned into Biogas (a renewable fuel) and soil improver. This can be done by collecting food waste separately without mixing it with inorganic waste matters.
                </div>
                <div class="aboutPoints"><b>Divert food waste going to landfill:</b> From uneaten leftovers to spoiled food that we toss in the bin eventually end up in landfills. Where it gets compacted and decomposed to emit methane- a potent greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. About 65% of the wastes found in landfills are bio-degradable. Sources of organic waste matter include food loss during harvest, transportation and storage, food waste from the preparation of meals, leftovers, and spoiled food from restaurants, markets, and homes; garden and yard waste.
                </div>
                <div class="aboutPoints"><b>Turn your food waste into biogas & Manure:</b>Food waste when fed to CHUGG undergoes a series of anaerobic digestion processes. During this process, Methane is produced and is captured in a chamber. This is then converted into Biogas using Nano-technology. Biogas can be used to produced heat, and electricity. In some places after series of filtration can be used as fuel for vehicles. The residue obtained is rich in soil nutrients making it an ideal fertilizer for crops. The energy and fertilizer obtained from CHUGG offset your investment by reducing the LPG bill, consumption of fossil fuel, and replacing chemical fertilizers which can be used in your own garden or sold to farmers.

        <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="points">
                <div class="aboutPoints"> The food waste categorization and management selection flowchart (i.e. the Food Waste Management Decision Tree) discussed in this paper facilitates the selection of the most sustainable food waste management alternative, with the objective of minimizing environmental impacts and maximising economic and social benefits. The categorization is intended to be easy to apply, facilitating identification of the type of food waste generated, and its link with the most appropriate food waste management alternative. This methodology has been illustrated with case studies from two large UK food and drink manufacturers. Their food waste types have been identified and their existing waste management practices compared to the proposed alternatives. It was found that a detailed breakdown of the types of food waste provides significantly better results than general itemisation, since bespoke solutions can be used for each food waste.</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">The analysis described can be applied to every type of food waste from every stage of the food supply chain. However, this methodology is expected to be more useful in the early stages (agricultural and manufacturing) of the food supply chain, where separate collection is generally carried out more effectively, than in the retailing and consumer stages where waste is often sent to municipal solid waste. Additionally, it is recommended to adapt the categorization to each food sector or business and include more waste management alternatives in the analysis (e.g. extraction of compounds of interest from food waste).</div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">The food waste categorization scheme is also useful for monitoring purposes. It provides an easy way to classify food waste in a business or a region to assess progress in management and sustainability and measure against other companies or areas. In order to do that, firstly a clear definition of food waste must be agreed, the boundaries of the system to analyse must be delimited, and afterwards the food waste types can be identified and quantified.
                </div>
                <div class="aboutPoints">Evaluating the relative merits of waste management alternatives is a complex task. The factors determining which solution is more convenient are difficult to assess and sometimes even difficult to identify, including yields of the processes, proximity of waste management facilities, tax regulations, and demand for by-products, amongst many others. As a consequence, the waste hierarchy should be applied to every type of food waste identified independently, rather than to food waste as a whole, and undertake an exhaustive analysis for each food waste. To meet this challenge the authors are developing an analysis method and associated figures of merit to allow quantitative comparison of waste management alternatives, with a focus on environmental impacts, as an improvement over the current, qualitative approach.
